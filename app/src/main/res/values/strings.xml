    <string name="story1">“Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there’s no wolf boy!”, they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.
        After a while, he got bored and cried ‘wolf!’ again, fooling the villagers a second time.
        The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock.
        After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, “Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!”</string>
